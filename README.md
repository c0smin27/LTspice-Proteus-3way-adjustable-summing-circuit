# LTspice / Proteus â€“ Three-Way Adjustable Summing Circuit with Amplifier Output

## Circuit Description

In the summing configuration, the operational amplifier (Op-Amp) takes multiple input signals and combines them into a single output, which is the amplified sum of those inputs. <br>
A bi-alternating current mirror is implemented using a combination of transistors and resistors, allowing the output current to be directly influenced and controlled by the input current. <br>
This stage of the circuit also provides isolation between the input and output, helping to reduce noise levels and stabilize output impedance, ultimately contributing to improved signal quality.

### Additionally, I designed the schematic in **Proteus** (PCB design and circuit simulation software).
